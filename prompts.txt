I have S@p500 stock data for 25 years in csv files in a directory called "sp500_stock_data"; the files contain the following columns: Date, Close, Adj Close, High, Low, Open, Volume, Ticker. Process all stocks in the directory. Set a variable called theYear to 2024. For each trading day in theYear, check if: - the adjusted close is at least 30% below the 100-day moving average on that trading day. If a stock meets these criteria, create a buy signal for that trading day. Create a sell signal when any one of these conditions is met on a later trading day: - the adjusted close is above the 100-day moving average on that trading day. - more than 40 trading days have elapsed since the buy signal was created for this stock. - we reach the end of theYear. Print the version of GPT used to create the code. For each stock that meets the buy and sell criteria at least once, put the following into a dataframe: - stock ticker, - buy date, - buy price, - the adjusted close percentage below the 100-day moving average when the buy signal was created, - sell price, - sell date, - percentage gain, - number of trading days between buy and sell. Sort the df by buy date and save to a csv file called theYear_perf.csv. Then, for each of these stocks, plot the: - theYear adjusted close prices, - buy and sell signals, - 100-day moving average. Show buy and sell signals as vertical dashed lines. Put the images in a directory called plots. Put the code in a function called play(). Before creating the code, outline precisely what you intend to do.

Process all stocks in the directory. Set a variable called theYear to 2024. For each trading day in theYear, check if: -Use price-based (e.g., moving averages) and momentum indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic) together for entry/exit signals. -Apply Exponential (EMA), Hull (HMA), or variable-length moving averages to better capture trends. -Confirm buy signals with higher-than-average trading volume or volume spikes to reduce false signals. -Use ATR or Bollinger Bands to avoid trading during high volatility or to adjust trade size. -Use stop-losses based on price or volatility and adjust position size dynamically. -Replace fixed holding periods with trailing stops or exit when momentum indicators weaken. -Adapt trading activity based on historically stronger months or days. -Combine technical signals with fundamentals like earnings, valuations, or analyst ratings for better filters. -Use ML to optimize parameters and detect complex patterns in indicator data. -Validate signals across multiple timeframes (daily, weekly) to reduce noise -Use market sentiment or news analytics to strengthen or filter signals. - Trade diversified stocks and allocate capital based on risk-adjusted returns. - If a stock meets these criteria, create a buy signal for that trading day. - Create a sell signal when any one of these conditions is met on a later trading day: - the adjusted close is above the 100-day moving average on that trading day. - more than 40 trading days have elapsed since the buy signal was created for this stock. - we reach the end of theYear.

This python code is used to read csv files of the past 25 years of stocks and make trade options based on certain criteria. It is currently making no trades. Without removing any criteria, change them to be easier to fulfill and explain each criteria

how do I add a section to the end of the result csv files to show total profit?

optimise the sell requirements

Write a complete Python script that backtests a single-position S&P 500 trading strategy over the last 10 years using daily 
CSV data in sp500_stock_data/, calculates EMA, HMA, RSI, MACD, Stochastic, ATR, and Bollinger Bands, executes buys/sells by 
defined technical rules, saves yearly trade results and summaries under results/, plots profit/loss and a 10-year equity curve, 
and includes a final summary in a results.txt file with total strategy, compounded gain and average annual gain (%), plot all 
trades each year in plot folder
